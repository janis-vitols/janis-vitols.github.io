Just a short message here for everyone who is interesed in Elixir language.

Guys from [Codeschool][codeschool]{:target="blank"} have created new path `Elixir` and already have two courses:

- [Try Elixir][try-elixir-course]{:target="blank"}
- [Mixing It Up With Elixir][mixing-it-up-course]{:target="blank"}

I have just checked free introduction course and I can approve - quality of course is good as always.
These guys know how to teach programming :)
