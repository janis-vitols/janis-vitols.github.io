Hi!

One day by surfing Internet I found out one great gem [githug][githug]{:target="blank"} by [Gary Rennie][githug-author]{:target="blank"}.
This gem is a learning game where you must finish level one by one using different Git commands.

Although I have used Git since I started to code in Ruby I decided to try it out and I liked it!
I liked it so much that after finishing game I decided to [contribute][githug-contribution]{:target="blank"} and add one more level to this learning game.

I have definately learned some new things about Git and thought I will write small blog post about it so maybe any of my readers will give it a shot and 
try out this awesome game!

Good luck and have fun learning Git by playing game! :)
