Hi!

One day while surfing the Internet I found a great gem - [githug][githug]{:target="blank"} by [Gary Rennie][githug-author]{:target="blank"}.
The gem is a learning game with levels, and each player must finish the levels one by one using different Git commands.

Even though I have used Git since I started coding in Ruby, I decided to try it out. And I liked it!
I liked it so much that after finishing the game I decided to [contribute][githug-contribution]{:target="blank"} and add one more level to this learning game.

I definitely learned something new, so the intention of this blog post is to encourage you, my readers, to go and give it a shot.

Good luck and have fun learning Git by playing the game! :)
