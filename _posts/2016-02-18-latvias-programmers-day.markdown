Hey!

Wanted to let you know that tomorrow is "[Latvias Programers Day 2016][programmers-day-2016]{:target="blank"}".
I will be there and do my small presentation talk on topic: "[Behaviour Driven Development][BDD]{:target="blank"} with
[Cucumber][cucumber-framework]{:target="blank"}". And then we will hold an BDD workshop there also. In our workshop we
are going to use [Cucumber.js][cucumber-js]{:target="blank"}.

See you there! :wink:
