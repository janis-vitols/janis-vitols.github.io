Hey, hey!

Just wanted to share with you, that I have decided to go to "RubyConfLT 2016".
This year conference tickets is not for free as it was last year, but last year it was
**so cool** that I decided to go even if the tickes will be for sale.
So as soon as I found out that RubyConfLT started to sell early bird
tickets - I jumped in and bouth one for myself.
