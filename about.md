I'm [Janis Vitols][linkedin]{:target="_blank"} and I live in [Riga][riga-map]{:target="_blank"}, [Latvia][latvia-map]{:target="_blank"}.

I consider myself a reasonably experienced Web Developer. Currently I enjoy coding in [Ruby][ruby-lang]{:target="_blank"} programming language.
As it happens for a lot of Ruby developers, I also started it all by tinkering with [Ruby on Rails][ruby-on-rails]{:target="_blank"}.
However I'm also interested in other frameworks which are based on Ruby programming language.

My idea with this blog is to start specializing more deeply in some particular areas of development. I will start with *testing* as I feel
it is the part I'm least competent in right now. But let's see where this journey takes me!
